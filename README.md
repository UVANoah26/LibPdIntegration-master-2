The Compo 2 for AVE

In its current form (compo 2) - I have a sawtooth synth which plays and a plane of prisms which react to the sound. Additionally, I have some simple drums which are getting added in every 4 measures based on a master clock.

For the Final Compo - the fleshed out version of this I have the following expectations: I would like to add voices of unison to my current sawtooth synth to create a "Reese Bass" sound (We covered in class I have not implemented yet). I would like to add better more musical reverb to the sampled drums. I would like to plan out my piece to have an intro and if possible a drop, maybe with a riser, although I am shaky on my music generation so it could end up as a long intro. The music will clearly have to speed up to fit the genre and right now the drums are too band and not EDM enough.

The ultimate goal musically for me is to create a 30"" Hardwave style piece. Visually I would like to make my prisim field to glide smoother and match it to the asthetic. (Moodier) I will be adding a second sound controlled element reactive to the kicks this will be a large element perhaps in the background where the scale of the object will feel worhty of the the reverby sound.

Finally, I would like the entire project to be visually complete in that everything in view of the camera will match the asthetic without immersion ruining skybox views etc.
